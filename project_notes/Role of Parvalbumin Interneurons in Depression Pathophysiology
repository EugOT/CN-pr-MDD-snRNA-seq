Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons are a subset of GABAergic neurons. They play a critical role in maintaining the balance of excitation and inhibition in brain circuits associated with mood regulation, stress, and depression. These fast-spiking interneurons regulate the activity of pyramidal neurons and synchronize network oscillations necessary for cognitive and emotional processes. PV interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC),  are particularly vulnerable to stress. Stress weakens excitatory synaptic inputs onto PV interneurons. This reduction in excitatory input diminishes PV interneuron activity, disrupting their ability to regulate pyramidal neuron firing This in turn leads to the development of maladaptive stress responses observed in depression.  [Perlman et al. 2021] [Perova et al. 2015]
In conditions of chronic stress, elevated inflammation in the local microenvironment and oxidative stress within neurons result in the loss of PV interneurons.  This phenomena likely occurs due to atrophy, apoptosis, or reduced PV expression. [Cabungcal et al. 2013] [Moga et al. 2002]
These effects are worsened by stress-induced alterations in the extracellular matrix (ECM), particularly in perineuronal nets (PNNs) that surround PV interneurons. The ECM provides structural support and regulates PV interneuron excitability. However, chronic stress reduces PNN density in brain regions like the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Such reductions contribute to impaired PV interneuron function and disrupt the excitation-inhibition balance in circuits critical for emotional regulation. PNN remodeling under chronic stress initially promotes plasticity through decreased PNN density, but prolonged alterations increase circuit rigidity, exacerbating depressive symptoms. [Spijker et al. 2020]

Post-mortem studies of human brains confirm reductions in PV interneurons in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder. [Knable et al. 2004, Konradi et al. 2011., Rajkowska et al. 2007] Moreover, these findings are supported by animal models. It is reported that stress-induced reductions in PV interneuron activity are linked to depressive traits such as learned helplessness. Mice classified as “helpless” in the learned helplessness model exhibit a significant decrease in excitatory input to PV interneurons in the mPFC compared to “resilient” or “naive” mice. This reduced activity impairs the ability of PV interneurons to control pyramidal neuron output and maintain network balance. Pharmacogenetic suppression of PV interneurons in these models further promotes helplessness, underscoring their critical role in resilience to stress.​  There is limited translatability of animal studies to human postmortem findings. This can partly be explained by differences in study design. Animal studies mostly compared stressed to non-stressed groups rather than grouping by behavior, whereas humans were grouped into phenotypic classes (psychiatric diagnoses), which inherently vary widely due to heterogeneity in the clinical populations with these disorders. [Perlman et al. 2021]


Chronic stress, a well-established risk factor for major depressive disorder (MDD), reduces the number and activity of PV interneurons in brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. This reduction disrupts the balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Thus, contributing to cognitive deficits, emotional dysregulation, and the emergence of depressive symptoms.  [Perlman et al. 2021]

PV interneurons influence neural circuits such as the VTA-PFC pathway, which regulates reward and stress responses. Dysregulation of this circuit due to impaired PV interneuron function contributes to anhedonia and blunted reward-seeking behaviors, traits of depression.​ [Perlman et al. 2021] [Perova et al. 2015]

One defining feature of PV interneurons is their association with perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs are extracellular matrix structures that protect PV neurons from oxidative stress, regulate synaptic transmission, and support plasticity. Chronic stress alters PNN density and composition, contributing to PV interneuron dysfunction and exacerbating depressive symptoms. Factors such as age, sex, and stress intensity further modulate the vulnerability of PV interneurons and PNNs to stress, depicting the complexity of their role in depression.  [Perlman et al. 2021]

Studies indicate that a reduction in PV interneurons in the ventral hippocampus, especially the ventral dentate gyrus, is associated with depression-like behaviors in mice. This reduction may be linked to increased neuroinflammation, suggesting a potential mechanism by which PV interneurons influence mood disorders [Chen et al. 2021]

PV interneurons express high levels of p11, a protein associated with depression and action of antidepressants.The activity of Kv3.1 channels in dentate gyrus PV cells is crucial for their function. In a study on mice the behavioral response to subthreshold stress with conditional deletion of p11 in PV cells was investigated to elucidate the function and mechanism of p11 in PV interneurons. The deletion of p11 from PV interneurons in a study on mice resulted in reduced hippocampal level of Kv3.1. The reduced Kv3.1 activity, due to the deletion of the p11 protein, leads to vulnerability to depression. The activity of dentate gyrus PV cells plays a major role in the behavioral response to novelty and stress. Activation of the Kv3.1 channel in dentate gyrus PV cells may represent a target for the development of cell-type specific, fast-acting antidepressants. [Medrihan et al. 2020] [Medrihan et al. 2019]

Additionally, epigenetic factors can contribute to the regulation of PV interneuron function. Alterations in DNA methylation, particularly involving DNMT1 in PV interneurons, can lead to changes in cortical circuit function and contribute to depression-like behaviors. [Linde et al. 2024]

Therapeutic interventions have shown promise in counteracting stress-induced reductions in PV interneuron function. Physical exercise, environmental enrichment, and antidepressant treatments like fluoxetine enhance PV interneuron plasticity, increase excitatory inputs, and improve network stability. Targeting PNNs, such as through enzymatic degradation, has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for reversing stress-induced reductions in PV interneuron function. Recent studies suggest that restoring PV interneuron function through targeted interventions may help address the excitation-inhibition imbalances observed in depression. ​ [Perlman et al. 2021] [Perova et al. 2015]

The role of PV interneurons in depression highlights their involvement in stress susceptibility, resilience, and therapeutic response. Disruptions in PV interneuron function lead to imbalances in neural circuits that are essential for reward processing, emotional regulation, and adaptive responses to stress. Continued research on PV interneurons, their interaction with PNNs, and their modulation by environmental and pharmacological factors will provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of depression and potential treatment strategies​.
