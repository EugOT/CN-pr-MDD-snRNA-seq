Depression is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder. It involves complex molecular mechanisms that vary across different cell types in the brain. A major challenge in understanding depression at a cellular level is the difficulty of isolating gene expression changes specific to individual cell types. On top of that, opposing molecular changes across cell populations can be difficult to detect because the changes are averaged across whole populations. [Handley et al. 2015] 

The central nervous system (CNS) comprises two major types of cells: neurons and glial cells, which work together to regulate brain function. On one hand, neurons transmit electrical signals, glial cells provide crucial support, ensuring homeostasis, protection, and metabolic balance necessary for neuronal function. On the other hand, glial cells are vital for CNS function, contributing to synaptic modulation, development, protection, metabolic support, and communication. Their dynamic interactions with neurons are essential for maintaining CNS health and responding to injury or disease.[Hansson et al. 2003, Sanchoet al. 2020, Allen et al. 2018, Jessen et al. 2004]

One of the brain regions implicated in depression is the nucleus accumbens (NAc). The NAc is often associated with reward and motivation. More than 95% of NAc is primarily composed of 2 subtypes of medium spiny neurons (MSN) - either rich in dopamine receptors D1 or D2.  These neurons play opposite roles in reward, action-value, reinforcement, and responses to drug abuse. [Fox 2019, Francis 2017, Soares-Cunha 2016]
One factor whose role is implicated in depression is Shisa6. Shisa6 is a protein found in D1-MSNs enhancing synaptic excitability. Increased levels of Shisa6 have been linked to anxiety- and depression-like behaviors by altering reward and motivation circuitry function in the NAc. [Kim et al. 2021]

In addition to MSNs, dopaminergic neurons originating from ventral tegmental areas (VTA) play crucial roles in regulating reward-related behaviors. Their increased neuron firing, or hyperactivity, is caused by chronic stress. Several mechanisms regulate dopaminergic neuron activity in depression. These include KCNQ potassium channels, Cav1.3 calcium channels, β2-nAChR signaling, BDNF signaling, and AKT signalling. [Fox et al. 2019]

The upregulation of KCNQ potassium channels reduces firing of the NAc-projecting dopamine neurons. On the other hand, increased Cav1.3 calcium channels activity has been linked to reduced VTA dopamine neuron firing which leads to anhedonia and social withdrawal. Similarly, β2-nAChRs signalling works by modulated dopaminergic activity when switching neurons between excited and depressed states. Conversely, the activation of β2-nAChRs has been associated with stress resilience, while their inhibition contributes to depressive behaviors by decreasing dopamine neuron firing. [Fox et al. 2019]

Additionally, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signalling is another critical pathway implicated in depression. BDNF levels increase in stress-susceptible individuals and mediate depressive-like behaviors by enhancing synaptic plasticity and excitability in the VTA-to-NAc circuit pathway. This is associated with depressive-like behaviors by enhancing synaptic plasticity and excitability. [Fox et al. 2019]
The AKT signalling pathway plays a pivotal role in regulating dopaminergic neuron excitability and is downregulated in depression. Reduced AKT activity leads to decreased inhibition via GABAA receptors and increased excitability of VTA dopamine neurons, contributing to stress susceptibility. [Fox et al. 2019]

As part of the inhibitory neurons, the GABAergic neurons modulating synaptic inhibition are also affected in depression. GABAergic neurons in the VTA inhibit dopaminergic neurons, affecting reward sensitivity. Reactivating this circuit can ameliorate reward insensitivity caused by chronic stress, suggesting a mechanism by which stress modulates reward processing [Sun et al. 2021]. In the VTA, GABAergic neurons inhibit dopaminergic neurons, mediating stress-induced changes in reward-seeking behavior, a core symptom of depression. [Lowes et al. 2021] [Sun 2021] [Bouarab et al. 2019] Dysregulation of these circuits disrupts the balance between reward anticipation and stress responses, central to depressive symptoms.

Beyond neurons, glial cells play essential roles in depression pathophysiology. The major types of glial cells include astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes.[Jessen et al. 2004]

Astrocytes, responsible for maintaining neurotransmitter homeostasis, exhibit impaired glutamate uptake in depression. This leads to excitotoxicity and impaired synaptic function. [Mahmoud et al. 2019] Microglia, the brain’s immune cells, contribute to neuroinflammation through the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and excessive synaptic pruning, exacerbating depressive symptoms. [Singhal et al. 2017] Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) support myelination and synaptic plasticity. OPCs show significant alterations in depression, leading to impaired neural connectivity and cognitive deficits. [Zhou et al. 2020]

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of cellular interactions and crosstalk in depression. Neurons and glial cells interact extensively to maintain synaptic balance, neurotransmitter regulation, and immune responses.[Liu et al. 2023] Astrocytes regulate neurotransmitter clearance and energy supply, while microglia respond to neuroinflammatory signals by modulating synaptic remodeling and immune responses. Neurons, in turn, release activity-dependent signals such as glutamate and ATP, that influence astrocytic and microglial activity. Disruptions in these interactions contribute to neuronal dysfunction observed in depression. 

Sex-specific differences at the cellular level have also been observed in depression. In males, astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) exhibit significant changes in gene expression, whereas in females, it is the microglia and inhibitory parvalbumin interneurons that show more pronounced dysregulation. Despite these differences, broad cell-type clusters show largely concordant molecular changes between the sexes. Other cell types, including endothelial cells, peripheral immune cells, neural stem cells, interneurons, pericytes, and ependymal cells, contribute to depression by influencing neurovascular integrity, immune signaling, and neurogenesis. [Maitra 2023]

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying depression at the cell-type-specific level is important for developing targeted therapeutic strategies. Advances in single-cell analysis and cell-specific interventions hold promise for more precise and effective treatments in the future.
