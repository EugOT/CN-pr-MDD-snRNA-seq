1.	How does neuroinflammation affect the function of PV interneurons in patients with MDD, and can ketamine counteract these effects?
Chronic stress and neuroinflammation have been shown to impact the functionality of PV interneurons, disrupting inhibitory control in the prefrontal cortex, which is critical in MDD pathology. Exploring how inflammatory markers such as IL-6 and TNF-α alter PV interneuron function and whether ketamine’s known anti-inflammatory properties can restore their activity could provide valuable insights. This research might support the hypothesis that targeting inflammation could enhance ketamine’s therapeutic efficacy, ultimately leading to more individualized treatment strategies. (Beurel et al., 2020).
